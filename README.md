# Build_Your_Own_World

In this Project, I created an engine for generating explorable worlds. This is a large design project that requires working through every stage of development from ideation to presentation. The goal of this project was to practice and learn how to handle a larger piece of code with little starter code in the hopes of emulating something like a product development cycle.
It is a very open-ended project and requires a great deal of exploration and experimentation. That is, this project is about software engineering.
